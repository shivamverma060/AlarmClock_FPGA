# AlarmClock_FPGA

The project implements an alarm clock on an FPGA using Verilog code.

The Verilog code is fully synthesizable, meaning that it can be converted into hardware that can be implemented on an FPGA.
The alarm clock outputs a real-time clock with a 24-hour format.
The alarm clock also provides an alarm feature, which can be set by the user through switches.
The project is implemented using a simple design that is easy to understand and modify.

Here are some of the key features of the project:

The use of Verilog code for the implementation makes it easy to synthesize the design for an FPGA.
The real-time clock feature provides a useful functionality for users.
The alarm feature is a valuable addition to the clock, as it allows users to be woken up at a specific time.
The simple design makes the project easy to understand and modify.
